# Data Science Methodologies:
This repo contains my practice learning various methodologies for Analysing Data.
These Include:
- Regression
- Classifiacation
- Clustering
- Time Series
- Anomoly Detection
- Natural Language Processing


## Methodologies
All methodologies encompased the entirety of the Data Pipeline, starting with acquisition and preparation of data and ending on a presentation of findings.

### I. Regression
> Final Project can be found at https://github.com/DomPedrotti/zillow-regression-project

Libraries used and Dependancies:
- **Pandas** for database manipulation
- **Numpy** for matrix manipulation
- **Scipy** for statistics
- **Sklearn** model_selection, preprocessing, linear_model, feature_selection, metrics
- **Pydataset** for training dataframes
- **Seaborn** for data Visualization
- Must have an env file to replicate SQL queries. If you're not a Codeup Student or Professor, you will not be able to obtain this

### II. Classification
> Final Project can be found at https://github.com/DomPedrotti/Classification_Project

Libraries used and Dependancies:
- **Pandas** for database manipulation
- **Numpy** for matrix manipulation
- **Sklearn** model_selection, preprocessing, feature_selection, metrics, neighbors, linear_model, tree, ensemble
- **Pydataset** for training dataframes
- **Seaborn** for data Visualization
- Must have an env file to replicate SQL queries. If you're not a Codeup Student or Professor, you will not be able to obtain this

### III. Clustering
> Final Project can be found at https://github.com/LambDom/Zillow-logerror

Libraries used and Dependancies:
- **Pandas** for database manipulation
- **Numpy** for matrix manipulation
- **Sklearn** cluster, model_selection, preprocessing, metrics
- **Pydataset** for training dataframes
- **Seaborn** for data Visualization
- Must have an env file to replicate SQL queries. If you're not a Codeup Student or Professor, you will not be able to obtain this

### IV. Time Series and Anomaly Detection
> Final Project can be found at https://github.com/Dom-Misty

Libraries used and Dependancies:
- **Pandas** for database manipulation
- **Numpy** for matrix manipulation
- **Sklearn** metrics, model_selection, preprocessing, cluster
- **Re** for Regular Expressions
- **Pydataset** for training dataframes
- **Seaborn** for data Visualization
- Must have an env file to replicate SQL queries. If you're not a Codeup Student or Professor, you will not be able to obtain this
