# Data Science Methodologies:
This repo contains my practice learning various methodologies for Analysing Data.
These Include:
- Regression
- Classifiacation
- Clustering
- Time Series
- Anomoly Detection
- Natural Language Processing


## Summaries
All methodologies encompased the entirety of the Data Pipeline, starting with acquisition and preparation of data and ending on a presentation of findings.

### I. Regression
> Final Project can be found at https://github.com/DomPedrotti/zillow-regression-project

Libraries used and Dependancies:
- **Pandas** for database manipulation
- **Numpy** for matrix manipulation
- **Scipy** for statistics
- **Sklearn** model_selection, preprocessing, linear_model, feature_selection, metrics
- **Pydataset** for training dataframes
- **Seaborn** for data Visualization
- Must have an env file to replicate SQL queries. If you're not a Codeup Student or Professor, you will not be able to obtain this
